**Eternal Covenant Commercial License Agreement**

This Commercial License Agreement ("Agreement") is made effective as of [Effective Date] by and between THE FARM ("Licensor") and You (either an individual or an entity), herein referred to as "Licensee."

WHEREAS, Licensor owns and has developed Eternal Covenant ("Software"), a comprehensive MMORPG game based on biblical narratives and historical settings, which includes computer software, associated media, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation;

WHEREAS, Licensee wishes to use the Software for commercial purposes under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises made herein, the Licensor and Licensee agree as follows:

1. **Grant of License**: Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee accepts, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

2. **Use of Software**: Licensee is permitted to:
   a. Install and use the Software for commercial purposes.
   b. Modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the Software for internal use or direct commercial gain, provided such modifications do not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights.

   a. Licensee shall not distribute, sell, lease, rent, lend, or sublicense the Software or any derivative works thereof without the prior written consent of Licensor.
   b. Licensee shall not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.

4. **Intellectual Property Rights**: The Software and all copies thereof, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights, are owned by the Licensor. The Licensee does not acquire any rights, express or implied, other than those expressly granted in this Agreement.

   a. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in effect until terminated by either party.

8. **General**:
   a. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings.
   b. This Agreement may only be amended in writing signed by both parties.
   
Absolutely, replacing the witness line with a clause that states downloading or using the software signifies agreement to the terms is a common practice, especially for software distributed electronically where a traditional signature is not feasible. Here's how you could modify the bottom section of the agreement:

**Acceptance**
By downloading, installing, or using Eternal Covenant ("Software"), you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install, or use the Software.
